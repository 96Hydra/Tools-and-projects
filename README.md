# Projects and Tools
A repo with some cool tools and projects i've decided to do to teach myself Python, C, and Powershell. Some have a use, some serve literally no purpose other then to prank my coworkers. 

I decided to throw this together so I can have some of the things I can do showcased on my resume. I'll have a wide range of offensive and defensive tools as well as just dumb little side projects I do when I get bored, or want to challenge myself.

I hope you enjoy!
